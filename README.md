# Sustainability of a 'Surf & Ice Cream shop' in Hawaii Based on Temperature Data

For this analysis, its been asked to determine the sustainability of opening a surf and ice-cream shop in Hawaii based on the weather. Due to a past failure, an investor had a primary main concern regarding the weather (specifically the rain) and wants to know the summary statistics on the dataset provided - [hawaii.sqlite](hawaii.sqlite)


Results:

The dataset spans from years 2010-2017, and the result of the analysis on the Hawaii dataset resulted in the two below tables:

### Figure 1 - June Temperatures

### Figure 2 - December Temperatures

There are three key differences from the two analysis in weather between June and December:
- Average temperatures drop from 75째 in June to 71째F in December
- Lowest temperature of 56째F in December while the lowest temperature for June was 64째F
- December's temperature data shows there are a wider range in higher temperatures, as the upper quartile extends further from the mean in comparison to Junes data
    - which could mean there is more variability in higher temps in December, where in June temperatures don't vary and fairly stay the same from year to year

Summary:

Considering temperatures at its lowest in December is still considered fairly good weather for surfing and ice-cream, so based on temperature alone it can be seen as a sustainable business. 

But two additional queries looking at precipitation data over the years comparing June and December, would be a stronger analysis as this was the main concern of the investor.
